# Reflective-Programming. What is it?
Reflective programming is a specific type of metaprogramming that refers to the ability of a program to function and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime. In other words, it is an ability for a program to examine and change its own behavior or data structure while it is running.


# My Exemples
Framework-Persistence is a Framework that inserts and loads any object in The Database using reflexive programing. 
it gets from the on program the information that he needs. I used MySQL in this case, but you can you whatever you want.
 
In the File "Reflixibilidade" I have made a code that gets the information from the class by using Annotations and Reflexive programming and calculates the LCOO of the class.
the user only needs to fill in the top of the methods of the class and Constructor what Attribute is used in that determined method or constructor, and the code will show the LCOO running the main.
The code is in the LCOO package.
